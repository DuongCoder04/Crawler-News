## 🎯 Technical Solutions

### Challenge 1: Authentication Complexity

**Problem:** Original design required API calls with JWT token authentication  
**Solution:** Implemented direct PostgreSQL connection using psycopg2  
**Result:** Simpler architecture, no authentication overhead, faster execution

### Challenge 2: Attachment Foreign Key Constraint

**Problem:** `attachment` table has FK constraint to `merchants`, cannot link to `news`  
**Solution:** Embed thumbnail URL directly in content as `<img>` tag  
**Result:** No schema changes needed, thumbnails display correctly

### Challenge 3: Source Tracking Without Schema Changes

**Problem:** User doesn't want to add `source_url` or `source_name` fields to database  
**Solution:** 
- Use Redis cache for duplicate detection (90-day TTL)
- Embed source info in HTML comments within content
**Result:** Full tracking capability without any database modifications

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Direct database connection** - Simpler than API approach
2. **Redis for duplicate detection** - Fast and reliable
3. **Embedding thumbnails in content** - Avoided FK constraint issues
4. **HTML comments for metadata** - Clean solution without schema changes

### Technical Decisions

1. **Python over Node.js** - Better ecosystem for web scraping
2. **BeautifulSoup over Scrapy** - Simpler for static HTML
3. **psycopg2 over ORM** - Direct control over queries
4. **Redis over database** - Faster duplicate checking

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring

- Check logs: `tail -f Crawler/logs/crawler.log`
- Check database: `node wise-cms-backend/test-db-connection.js`
- Check Redis: `redis-cli KEYS crawler:article:*`

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection failed** - Check PostgreSQL is running
2. **Redis connection failed** - Check Redis is running
3. **No articles crawled** - Check domain config and logs
4. **Duplicate articles** - Check Redis cache is working

### Maintenance Tasks

- Monitor log file size (auto-rotates at 10MB)
- Check Redis memory usage
- Review crawler performance metrics
- Update domain configs as websites change
